# Project 3: RF System Decomposition (Applied Engineering Task)

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding and analyzing a complete RF (Radio Frequency) communication system by breaking it down into its main functional blocks. The purpose is to study how each component contributes to the overall system operation.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to decompose an RF system into individual stages such as transmitter, channel, and receiver, and to explain the role of each block in the signal transmission process.

## RF System Components
A typical RF communication system consists of the following main components:
- Signal source
- Modulator
- RF transmitter
- Communication channel
- RF receiver
- Demodulator
- Output device

Each block performs a specific function to ensure reliable transmission and reception of information.

## Methodology
The project is completed using the following steps:
1. Selection of a basic RF communication system.
2. Identification of all major system blocks.
3. Explanation of the function of each block.
4. Analysis of how signals are affected by noise and interference.
5. Discussion of real-world applications of the RF system.

## Tools and References
- Course lecture materials
- Textbooks on wireless communication
- Online technical resources

## Outcome
This project provides a clear understanding of RF system architecture and helps explain how different components work together in wireless communication systems.

## Conclusion
By decomposing the RF system into smaller functional blocks, the project improves understanding of signal flow, system design, and practical RF communication principles.
