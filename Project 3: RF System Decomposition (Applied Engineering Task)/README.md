RF System Block Descriptions
1. Information Source / MCU

The ARM® Cortex®-M4F microcontroller functions as the main control unit of the system. It runs the application firmware and manages the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol stack. This block is responsible for generating digital data for transmission and processing the data received from the RF subsystem.

2. RF Transceiver

The RF transceiver is a versatile 2.4 GHz radio supporting multiple wireless standards. It implements the physical layer operations and allows the device to switch efficiently between transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) modes during wireless communication.

3. Modulation / Demodulation

This stage uses Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK). On the transmit side, it maps digital bits into frequency-modulated analog waveforms. On the receive side, it demodulates the incoming RF signal to recover the original digital data stream.

4. Power Amplifier (PA)

The integrated Power Amplifier boosts the RF signal level before it is delivered to the antenna. It supports programmable output power levels (up to +8 dBm), which directly influence communication range, link quality, and overall system performance.

5. Low Noise Amplifier (LNA)

The LNA is positioned at the front of the receiver chain and amplifies very weak signals picked up by the antenna. It is optimized to provide sufficient gain while adding minimal noise, allowing the system to reliably receive low-power or distant transmissions.

6. RF Filtering / Matching Network

This block is composed of passive RF components that match the impedance between the radio circuitry and the antenna (typically 50 Ω). It also serves as a band-pass filter, reducing harmonics and suppressing unwanted out-of-band signals to comply with regulatory standards.

7. Antenna Interface

The antenna interface (ANT pin) provides the physical connection between the RF circuitry and the antenna. It enables bidirectional transfer of RF energy, forming the link between the on-board electronics and the surrounding electromagnetic environment.

8. Power Supply for RF Section

The RF subsystem is powered using internal DC/DC converters and low-dropout (LDO) regulators. These components supply a stable and low-noise voltage, isolating sensitive analog RF blocks from digital switching noise generated by the MCU.
