Wireless Communication Performance Comparison
Objective

This project performs a comparative analysis of three common wireless communication technologies: WiFi (IEEE 802.11b), Bluetooth, and 2G Cellular (GSM). Through simulation, the study examines how increasing distance affects received signal strength, signal-to-noise ratio (SINR), and channel capacity for each system.

Simulation Results Overview

The simulation evaluates WiFi, Bluetooth, and Cellular performance across their typical operating distance ranges. A logarithmic distance scale is used to clearly show differences in behavior over short and long distances.

Comparative Performance Plot

Key Results

Received Power and Propagation Loss
Each technology shows a logarithmic decrease in received power as distance increases. Cellular communication sustains higher received power over extended distances due to its high transmit power (40 W) and lower carrier frequency (850 MHz).

Channel Capacity (Effect of Bandwidth)
WiFi provides the highest channel capacity because of its large 22 MHz bandwidth. In comparison, 2G Cellular achieves the lowest capacity despite high transmit power, as its performance is limited by a narrow 200 kHz bandwidth.

Technology Trade-offs

Cellular: Optimized for wide-area coverage at the expense of data rate.

WiFi: Offers a compromise between reasonable coverage (around 100 m) and high throughput.

Bluetooth: Focuses on very low power consumption (approximately 10 mW), resulting in reduced range and data capacity for short-distance connections.
