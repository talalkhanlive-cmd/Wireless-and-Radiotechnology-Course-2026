% --- COMPARATIVE STUDY SUMMARY ---
%
% 1. SIMULATION DESCRIPTION
% This MATLAB script evaluates and compares the physical-layer behavior of
% WiFi (IEEE 802.11b), Bluetooth, and 2G Cellular (GSM) communication systems.
% The analysis uses the Friis Transmission Formula to compute received power
% and the Shannon–Hartley theorem to estimate channel capacity.
%
% 2. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS & OBSERVATIONS
% * Received Power and Propagation Loss:
%   All three wireless technologies exhibit a logarithmic reduction in
%   received power as transmission distance increases, consistent with
%   free-space propagation theory. Cellular communication sustains higher
%   received power across longer distances due to its very high transmit
%   power (40 W) and lower carrier frequency (850 MHz).
%
% * Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR):
%   Since noise power (Pn) is assumed constant, the SINR trends follow the
%   received power curves. Bluetooth experiences a rapid SINR degradation
%   because of its low transmit power (10 mW), limiting its effective range
%   to short distances.
%
% * Channel Capacity Characteristics:
%   - WiFi delivers the highest channel capacity owing to its large bandwidth
%     (22 MHz) combined with moderate transmit power.
%   - Bluetooth offers the lowest capacity due to its narrow bandwidth
%     (2 MHz) and low power operation, making it suitable only for short-range,
%     low-data-rate applications.
%   - Cellular systems, despite their high transmit power, achieve relatively
%     low channel capacity because of the strict bandwidth limitation
%     (200 kHz). This reflects the design focus of 2G systems on coverage and
%     voice communication rather than high-speed data.
%
% 3. CONCLUSIONS
% The simulation results emphasize fundamental trade-offs in wireless system
% design:
% - Coverage versus Throughput: Cellular systems prioritize long-range
%   connectivity at the expense of data rate, while WiFi emphasizes higher
%   throughput over shorter distances.
% - Power Efficiency versus Performance: Bluetooth minimizes power usage to
%   extend battery life, which results in reduced range and channel capacity.
