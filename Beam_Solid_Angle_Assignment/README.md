# Beam Solid Angle Calculation using MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB code to compute the beam solid angle of an antenna
using its radiation pattern and numerical integration in spherical coordinates.

## Description
The beam solid angle is calculated by integrating the normalized power pattern
over theta and phi. Spherical coordinates and numerical summation are used.

For an upper bound of theta equal to 90 degrees, the calculated beam area is
approximately **2.10 steradians**.
