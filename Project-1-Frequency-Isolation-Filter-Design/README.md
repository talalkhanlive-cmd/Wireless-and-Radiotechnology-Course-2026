# Project 1: Filter Design for Signal Frequency Components

## Overview
This project focuses on the design of analog filters to isolate specific frequency components from a composite signal.

## Input Signal
The input signal consists of four sinusoidal frequency components:
100 Hz, 200 Hz, 300 Hz, and 400 Hz.

## Methodology
A composite signal is generated and appropriate filters are designed to isolate required frequency components.

## Tools Used
MATLAB and Signal Processing Toolbox.

## Conclusion
The designed filters successfully isolate the desired frequency components.
