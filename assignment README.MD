# Beam Solid Angle Calculation using MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB code for computing the beam solid angle of an antenna
using its radiation pattern and numerical integration in spherical coordinates.

## Assignment Overview
The objective of this assignment is to calculate the beam solid angle in steradians
by integrating the normalized power pattern over theta and phi. The calculation is
performed using MATLAB and spherical coordinates.

For an upper bound of theta equal to 90 degrees, the resulting beam area is
approximately **2.10 steradians**.

## Notes
The beam solid angle is computed using numerical summation based on the antenna
radiation pattern provided during program execution.
